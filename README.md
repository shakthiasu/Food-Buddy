# Food-Buddy

Food Buddy allows the user to navigate any restaurant menu with ease. The user is able to search any menu dish to simply see a visual example of the dish as well as key ingredients to the dish as well as nutritional information. When using Restaurant Buddy, the user can simply and effectively search thousands of dishes from endless cultures. The application utilizes an API function from the Edamam database, which is coded in Android studio to retrieve results and structure results. The way the API is implemented helps the end user to get details about the dish so they have an idea of what they are ordering and what it looks like and what is in the dish. Users are also able to search using the voice function to get the desired result as they would when typing in the dish, this is to ensure efficiency and ease of use functionality.
